No matter what painful things happens, even when it looks like you'll lose...
when no one else in the world believes in you...
when you don't even believe in yourself...
I will believe in you!

Ever since that fiery night, my time has been stopped.
But it was you who melted my frozen heart and kindly made my stopped time
begin to move forward again.

I can always tell when youâ€™re lying.
I also know that you cannot tell me why you do so.
So there is no need to convince me, or wrap everything in lies,
or try to take the blame on yourself like that.
Because I have complete faith in you.

When you said that you hate yourself,
it made me want to tell you all the wonderful things I know about you.

I love it when you stroke my hair. I feel as if we can understand 
each other through the contact between your hand and my hair. 
I love your voice. Just hearing you say one word makes my heart feel warmer. 
I love your eyes. Normally, they look stern, but when you're being kind to someone, 
I love the way they soften. I love your fingers. 
For a boy, you have such lovely fingers. 
But when they clutch me, I know they are the strong, slender fingers of a man. 
I love the way you walk. When we walk together, I love the way you occasionally turn, 
to make sure I keep up. I love the way you look when you sleep. 
You look unguarded, like an infant, and your eyelashes are on the long side. 
When I touch your cheek, you calm down... 
And when I playfully touch your lips, you don't even notice... 
And it makes my heart ache terribly. I love you.

I know I mustn't let my personal feelings interfere, but... 
I felt a little happy to keep you to myself.

You stole my sister's horn and stole my reason to live, but that wasn't enough? 
Now you have come here, and stole my reason to die too?
